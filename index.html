    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        This is a temporary website for iwantlife's coding shenannigans until he learns how to program
        properly in all of the front-end programming languages.

        Fun fact! Did you know that this text that you're reading right now at this moment was written in HTML? Pretty cool, don't you think?

    <h2>University Notes</h2>
    <h3>
        <a href="pages/uni.html">
            University Notes Main Page
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Ever wondered what life is studying right now? No? Well, too bad, because this also counts as life's way of tracking university notes (temporarily),
        for whatever godforsaken reason.

        Some people would argue that HTML is <em>not</em> the best place or method of writing down notes for university, but try telling that to Life.

    <h2>Life Updates</h2>
    <h3>
        <a href="pages/life.html">
            Life Updates Main Page
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        This section leads to life's personal updates page, where he writes about things that he would love to tell you all in person, 
        but knows that none of us has the actual time to talk about those things. Also a place for Life's weekly updates.

    <h2>Testing Facility</h2>
    <h3>
        <a href="pages/playspace.html">
            Testing Facility Main Page
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        This section is mostly just for life themselves, serving as a place for them to mess around with the intricacies of HTML, CSS, and Java
        (once they actually learn it, that is).
        Of course, you can feel free to access it and get some personal insight into the absolute madness that this person goes through
        on a daily basis, but there's a pretty good chance that most of the stuff leading from here will make absolutely no sense to anyone
        other than life themselves.

        At the very least, you can have it on life's word that going into this section <em>probably</em> won't completely destroy your computer,
        if only because I don't think life is smart enought to know how to do something like that.
