    <p>
        Hello! This is the first little life update, which is funny because I already use a journal personally.
        It makes one wonder whether or not these updates are actualy required, but then again, these updates aren't actually for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway! I should start by explaining what the giant green and black text at the top of the screen means.
        They're pretty intuitive, but essentially, the three categories refer to the three big progress marks in terms of my writing.
    </p>

    <p>        
        The first, "Monroe | xyz" refers to which stage of writing Monroe I'm in at any point, and how much of it is finished, rounded to the nearest integer.
        Currently, I'm on the Faux Draft of Monroe, which is a special draft in which I'm focusing on writing only the key most important chapters of the story
        to see if there's anything critically wrong with the state of the book. There are 9 chapters total that I'm hoping to write by the end of this month,
        which means that it'll increase in increments of 11% (rounding excluded) each time I finish writing a chapter of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second, "Words Written:" refers to the total number of words I've written for any of my writing projects since the last update (so usually in a week).
        This includes, but isn't actually limited to Monroe, meaning that I'll also be counting any writing that I do for personal practice, or submissions
        to the Monash Creative Writers. Just for reference, if this number is any lower than 7k words (1k words per day), you should absolutely call me out 
        on it because that means that I haven't been putting my face onto the grindstone as hard as I should be.            
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, "Total Words Written (Monroe):" is pretty simple, referring to the total number of words I've written for Monroe since I've started tracking it.
        This will include any specific drafts of Monroe, such as the Faux Draft, First Draft, and Second Draft, but it <strong>won't</strong> include
        any brainstorming that I do for Monroe (unless it's some kind of scene practice). The second brainstorming session starts in April, so this number
        won't move significantly during that time, but otherwise, it should be moving quite consistently upwards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyway, for this first week, you'll probably notice that my wordcount bars are at N/A, since I haven't started actually tracking it.
        Once I do, that number should be more interesting to look at each week, to see how much progress I've been making.
        What I actually decide to track is subject to change, but for now, writing progress is probably good enough. I might add something like
        my fitness progress, or my programming progress, but we'll see.
    </p>

    <p>
        With that out of the way, here's the real weekly update:
    </p>

    <p>
        I've been doing pretty well this week! I started working on this temporary site, which I'll be using for the forseeable future.
        It's been a lot of fun, since working on it makes me feel like some kind of real programmer sometimes. I use an application called VSCode, which
        makes all my code a bunch of different funny colours and has all sorts of autofill options and in general is a tool used for actual professionals in
        the programming environment, which has been <em>super cool</em>. I will admit, though. HTML is honestly pretty easy to learn, I feel like most people
        could probably do it in an afternoon (or a weekend, more likely) if they tried. Doesn't make it any less fun, though.
    </p>

    <p>
        Part of why I've been putting so much effort into this site is because I plan to use this as a storage space for all of my uni notes.
        Is it a good idea? Probably not, to be honest. I might write a Let's Talk Life (LTL) about this and it would be too long to go into here, but I think it'll be alright
        since I'm already using other forms of notetaking methods and so this will just be a repository if I forget anything rather than my primary vessel for
        notetaking or remembering things. And plus, it helps with keeping my foundational html/css/java skills polished.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, I've moved over to linux for most of my uni work! I'm not entirely sure why I made this decision, other than the fact that I wanted
        an excuse to use this Virtual Machine (VM) more often. It helps, since it also seperates all of my normal stuff from my uni stuff, and creates
        a distinct space within my computer for <em>productive work :tm:</em> if that makes sense. Something something compartmentalising.
        Also means I'm not signed into most of the things I use to procrastinate, which helps a little.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyway, that's been the first weekly life update! I'll hopefully be back next week with another one of these.
        I actually wonder whether this site will be ready in time for you to read this weekly update without having to go into the archive.
        We'll see about that.
