    <h2>FIT1058</h2>
    <p>
        Main focus on getting started with the unit, like with the other classes.
        <br>
        Pre-Class: N/A
        <br>
        Seminars: Basics of set theory. Introduction to how to work with sets, such as listed below.
        <br>
        Applied: Enitrely based on setting up Linux.
    </p>
    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>
        Sets: An unordered list of non-repeating elements/members
        <br>
        Subsets: Sets whose elements/members fall entirely within the range of another set. All sets are subsets of itself,
        but a <strong>Proper Subset</strong> only applies when set =/= subset.
        (note: every set is a subset of itself!)
        <br>
        Supersets: If set A is a subset of set B, then set B is considered a superset of set A. Therefore, all sets are supersets of itself, as well.
        Once again,a <strong>Proper Superset</strong> only applies when superset=/=set.
        <br>
        <em>Note: if two sets are subsets AND supersets of each other, then the two sets must be equal.</em>
        <br>
        Power Subsets: When counting the number of possible subsets, each element in the set has the option to be included in the subset or excluded from
        the subset.
        As such, the number of possible subsets within a set is always equal to 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is equal to the number of elements within the set.
        This is called the Power Set of any set X, which is denoted by the symbol P(X).
        <br>
        The Universal Set: The Universe refers to all of the elements that are considered for a particular operation between sets. For example,
        the universe of all integers would be the set Z.
        <br>
        Set Complement: The complement of a set refers to all elements within a defined range (default the universe) that is not included within set X.
        This is expressed through the notation U / X.
        <br>
        Set Difference: A set compliment can be performed between sets within the same universe.
        The set differnce of set A to set B would be notated as "B / A".
        <br>
        Set Union: The union of two sets refer to all elements within the universe that is included in any sets within the union.
        A common way to think of it is to say "For Set A and Set B within Universe Z, the union of Set A and B would include
        all elements that are in universe Z that is in Set A <strong>OR</strong> Set B."
        <br>
        Set Intersection: The intersection of sets refers to all elements within the universe that is included in all sets within the intersection.
        A common way to think of it is to say "For Set A and Set B within Universe Z, the intersection of Set A and B would include only elements
        that are in universe Z that is in <strong>BOTH</strong> Set A and Set B."
        <br>
        De Morgan's Laws for Sets: De Morgan's Laws for sets refes to a pair of concepts, known as the <em>Theorem</em> and the <em>Corollary</em>.
        <br>
        The <strong>Theorem</strong> states that for Set A and B within Universe Z, the Set Complement of the Union of the two sets is equivalent to
        the Set Intersection of the complements of the two sets.
        <br>
        The <strong>Corollary</strong> states that for Set A and Set B within Universe Z, the Complement of the Intersection of Set A and Set B is
        equivalent to the Union of the Complement of Set A and Set B.
        <br>
        Symmetric Difference: The Symmetric Difference of Set A and B in Universe Z refers to the elements that are
        ONLY in Set A OR Set B, and NOT BOTH. (Exactly one of Set A and B).
    </p>
    <p>
        Ordered Pair: An Ordered Pair refers to two or more elements placed together in a specific order.
        <br>
        Cartesian Product: The Cartesian Product of two or more sets refers to all ordered pairs consisting of an element of the first set followed by
        an element of the next set.
        If all sets in a cartesian product are finite, the size of the cartesian product is equivalent to the size of all individual sets multiplied together.
        <br>
        Partitions: The Partition of a set refers to all <em>Disjoint</em>, <em>Nonempty</em> subsets of that set whose union is that set. Each subset in this 
        partition is referred to as a part, block, or cell of the partition.
