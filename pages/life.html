        Ever wondered what Life is up to, but don't feel like asking/don't want to ping them on Discord?
        You've come to the right place.
        Idea probably stolen from Brandon Sanderson, though I don't think the concept of a weekly blog belongs to him.

        Will Life actually update this once each week? Who knows, though it'd be neato if they did.

        Let's Talk Life is Life's place to talk about anything that's been on their life but don't feel like bringing it up with anyone in particular.
        The content here can range from the mundane, to the personal, to the professional; expect the unexpected when it comes to this section.

        This comedian tried making video essays, failed, then tried making a podcast and failed.
        Now they think just because all they have to do this time is write into a HTML document, they can actually accomplish something.
        It's almost admirable.
