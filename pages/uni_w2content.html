        Main focus: Functions and Relations: Injective, Bijective, and Surjective Functions
        <br>
        Pre-Class: Computation performs tasks in which information is transformed. In order to understand this process, we split it into parts:
        "What we start with"; 
        "What we end up with"; 
        "What needs to be done". 
        <br>
        Functions perform this in computer science through the following terms (for function f(x)):
        The Domain ("What we start with");
        The Codomain ("What we end up with");
        The rule ("What needs to be done").

        Budget contraint lines, which calculate the maximial distribution of two potential forms of consumption,
        and how they change depending on external factors (e.g jobseeker payments creating a vertical line in an otherwise linear graph).
        <br>
        Useless goods, because of their lack of value, create a horizontal line on the graph with equivalent utility,
        as the only value in the graph is from the useful goods.
        <br>
        For garbage goods, their possession actively reduces the utility of other goods, meaning that one must be compensated for possession of it.
        Thie creates a series of logarithmic graphs based off preference, with higher preference providing more of the useful good in return for less of the
        garbage good. This is established through the equation x ln (a) - y B <sup>z</sup>.
        <br>
        Perfect substitutes are represented by a linear equation of gradient -1, as the goods have identical uses and so a person would have derive
        equal utility from both of them.
