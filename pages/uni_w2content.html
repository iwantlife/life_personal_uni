        <br>
        Pre-Class: Computation performs tasks in which information is transformed. In order to understand this process, we split it into parts:
        "What we start with"; 
        "What we end up with"; 
        "What needs to be done". 
        <br>
        Functions perform this in computer science through the following terms (for function f(x)):
        The Domain ("What we start with");
        The Codomain ("What we end up with");
        The rule ("What needs to be done").
