If you're reading this, I'm hoping that you're not some stranger on the internet, and instead, are one of the few friends I've given the link to this
repository to...

If you *are* one of those friends, hello! It's nice to have you. This is my little github repository where I polish the coding I practice in an online course I'm taking
called The Odin Project.
As of the most current iteration of this README file, I'm not entirely sure what this is going to be, but I'm sure it'll end up being *something*. In my mind,
I thought this would be a fun opportunity to do some practical coding practice outside of my uni and online courses, but also I don't see a reason why this
*can't* also just have a bunch of random uni notes that I've been taking throughout the semester in it. May as well revise my uni topics, amiright?

Anyway, I'll probably be linking the actual hyperlink to the github site instead of the repository, so the likelihood of you reading this is pretty slim overall.

I'm hoping that by the end of the year, this will have gone from basic HTML formatting to a really neato little page featuring everything from HTML to CSS to Java.
After that? I'm not sure, maybe by next year I'll be good enough at all this that the idea of buying a domain and maintaining a personal blog or something would be viable.
How cool would that be? It's like old social media, where everyone maintained their own blog sites rather than just making Instagram or Facebook accounts.

Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. Have fun seeing your friend slowly develop his programming skills, and hope to Keelia he gets good enough to do this as a job one day if writing books doesn't work out.
